title: Web3.Storage APIs compared
description: Learn about the differences between our new API and our original APIs to decide which is the best fit for your use cases.

# Intro

Set the context:

- We have new APIs for content upload and management
  - Not yet 100% sure what the "marketing names" for the versions are... while drafting, we'll call the new shit "v2" and the old jam "v1".
- The new APIs use a new auth system with fun new acronyms (UCAN, DIDs, etc).
  - Supports new access patterns based on delegation
- v2 supports larger uploads by uploading directly to cloud storage, skipping CF worker bottleneck

Commonalities:

- Both APIs write into Elastic IPFS

  - v2 writes directly to cloud bucket, while v1 goes through an intermediate CF worker

- Both APIs require payment (after free resources are exhausted) & have the same pricing
  - Caveat: w3up is free during beta, but content stored during beta will need to be paid for eventually

Differences:

- Auth & accounts

  - v1 uses API tokens for auth, after registration via "magic link" or OAuth (GitHub).
  - v2 uses UCAN tokens generated by the client - access is granted after email registration of client's DID
    - once an account is registered, client can delegate to other UCAN agents

- Upload mechanics

  - v1 uploads to CloudFlare Workers, which then feed into the "storage backend"
    - imposes a 100MiB max upload limit per request
  - v2 uploads directly to cloud storage, using signed upload URLs provided by w3up service
    - has ~ 4GB per-request limit (I think... need to double check)

- HTTP API
  - v2 does not expose an HTTP API for end users yet
    - Must use JS client lib or CLI
